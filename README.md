# fair-and-efficient-soft-load-shedding

This is code for the paper "A parametric function based soft load shedding for fair and efficient allocation of electricity to large scale utility customers" . we used a barrier algorithm (a class of interrior point method) and analytical hessian to find an efficient algorithm to solve convex optimization problem with equality and inequality constraitns.
